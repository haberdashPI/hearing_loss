# Goals

I think the overall point of this lesson is to:

1. Pique student's interest in various engineering applications to hearing
   loss, and get into some of the challenges of doing that well.
2. Get students to appreciate the differences between what we can do with
  hearing aids/implants/newer devices and the quality of unimpaired human
  hearing.
3. Help students to understand some of the evidence supporting our understanding
   of human hearing as it relates to hearing loss, and where the gaps are.

# Overall Lesson Organization
Day 1:

1. ~2 min introduction, format
2. ~30 min intro to hearing loss and methods to address hearing loss
3. ~5 min break
4. ~23 min part 1 of hearing
4. ~15-20 min class discussion: identify limitations and propose solutions
5. ~10 min: part 2 lecture on human hearing (in context of how this relates
    to hearing loss)

Day 2:

1. ~5-10 min - review, answer any questions, intro
2. ~15 min - part 2 lecture on human hearing 
3. ~15-20 min class discussion: based on what we just learned about
   human hearing, identify limitations and propose solutions 
4. ~40 min: new or up-and-coming solutions to hearing loss

## Format of Discussions
1. ask students to identify limitations and propose solutions in small groups
2. get each group to provide their best limitation and solution and
  put those on the board
3. ask student if there's any limitation that's missing from the list
4. ask students to identify the merits and problems of each limitation/solution 
5. raise any additional limitations students missed

New slides / research that I need to do:

for day 2:
hearing slides
- rehab benefits (needs some research)
- kilgard study (or something more up-to-date?)
- tinnitus challenges

up-and-coming slides
- envelope decoding
- eye gaze
- ear machine

# Detailed time line

- 5 min break

- 23 min lecture (part 1 of 3, hearing lecture)

- 15-20 minute discussion: 
    - instructions - identify at least 2 problems with current approaches
      to addressing hearing loss and then propose possible solutions
    - 10 minutes to discuss in small groups possible limitations and solutions
    - 5-10 minute class discussion about those proposed solutions

- 10 min discussion (part 2 of 3, hearing lecture)

Day 1 & 2
