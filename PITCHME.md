## Three Parts

- Hearing Assessment
- Hearing Loss                     |
- Improving Hearing - Hearing Aids |

# Part 1: Hearing Assessment

---

## Audiogram

---

## Signal-detection Theory

---

## Audiometer

---

## Audiometer Calibration

---

## Loudness

---

## High-frequency Audiometery

## High-frequency Challenges

**Standing Waves**

## High-frequency Challenges

**Standing Wave-effects**

---

## Accounting for Standing Waves

**Measure distance to ear drum**

## Otoacoustic Emissions

## Otoacoustic Emissions

**Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE)**

## Otoacoustic Emissions

**Outer hair cells generate sound**

## Hearing in Noise

**Audiogram poorly predicts speech-in-noise performance**

## Hearing in Noise

**Adjust SNR of speech vs. speech-like noise**

## Cognitive Load

**Similar accuracy, Increased effort**

# Part 2: Hearing Loss

---

## Temporary Hearing Loss

**Everyday listening leads to short-term hearing loss**

<!-- TODO: show levels of sounds that will lead to a threshold shift -->

---

## Temporary Hearing Loss

**Excessive force damages hair cells

<!-- TODO: show image of ear, then cochela, then hair cells damageds -->

---

## Temporary Hearing Loss

**Damaged hairs cells lead to damaged synapses**

<!-- TODO: same image as above, but with synapses highlighted -->

---

## Temporary to Perament Loss

**Poorly understood**

<!-- TODO: question marks -->

---

## Hidden Hearing Loss

<!-- TODO: show changed suprathreshold responses -->

<!-- TODO: show changes in synaptic ribbons -->
