## Three Parts

- Hearing Assessment
- Hearing Loss                     |
- Improving Hearing - Hearing Aids |

## Loudness

## High-frequency Audiometery

<!-- TODO: research project -->

basic idea: hearing loss generally begins at the highest frequencies, so we miss
a lot by not measuring the higher frequencies

---

## Problem: High-frequency calibration

things that influence high-frequency sound levels at the eardrum

shape of the ear canal
insertion depth of headphone

we can account for this by playing a tone and measure the time it takes to bounce off
the ear, and then compensate for the shape for the ear canal

# Part 2: Hearing Loss

---

---

## Temporary Hearing Loss

**Everyday listening leads to short-term hearing loss**

<!-- TODO: show levels of sounds that will lead to a threshold shift -->

---

## Temporary Hearing Loss

**Excessive force damages hair cells

<!-- TODO: show image of ear, then cochela, then hair cells damageds -->

---

## Temporary Hearing Loss

**Damaged hairs cells lead to damaged synapses**

<!-- TODO: same image as above, but with synapses highlighted -->

---

## Temporary to Perament Loss

**Poorly understood**

<!-- TODO: question marks -->

---

## Hidden Hearing Loss

<!-- TODO: show kujawa audiograms -->

<!-- TODO: show changed suprathreshold responses -->

<!-- TODO: show changes in synaptic ribbons -->

---

## Cognitive Load

<!-- TODO: show an image describing the hypothesis -->

## Cognitive Load

<!-- TODO: describe pupilometry -->
