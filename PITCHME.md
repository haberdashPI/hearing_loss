## Costs

**Hearing loss impacts a lot of people**

- 1 in 10 people have hearing loss
- >65 years: 1 in 3

Note: Why would we want to use pure tones at different frequencies
to test people's hearing? (Hint: Fourier transform)

## Hearing Aids - Compression

- Compression is applied separately to multiple frequency bands (~12)

Notes: Why would we have separate channels of compression
